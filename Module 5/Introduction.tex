\section*{Introduction to Module 5}

Welcome to Module 5.

After completing the online activities for this module, you will be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model a discrete random variable with a Binomial distribution:} Understand how to represent and analyze a discrete random variable that follows a Binomial distribution, including calculating probabilities and expected values.
    
    \item \textbf{Model a continuous random variable with a Normal distribution:} Learn how to describe and work with continuous random variables that follow a Normal distribution, including finding probabilities, mean, and standard deviation.
    
    \item \textbf{Understand the sample mean as a random variable:} Recognize that the sample mean is itself a random variable and learn about its properties and behavior.
    
    \item \textbf{Describe the sampling distribution of the sample mean:} Gain insights into the distribution of sample means, including the concept of sampling distribution and its importance in statistical inference.
    
    \item \textbf{Calculate the expected value and standard deviation of the sample mean:} Learn how to compute the expected value and standard deviation of the sample mean, which are critical for understanding the variability and precision of sample estimates.
\end{itemize}

We will explore these concepts in detail to build a solid foundation for understanding random variables and their distributions.
