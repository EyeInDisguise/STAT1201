\section*{Warner's Method}

Warner's method is a randomized response technique used to estimate sensitive proportions. Suppose 200 university students are asked the sensitive question: ``If you or your girlfriend accidentally got pregnant, would you seriously consider the possibility of an abortion?'' Each student secretly tosses a fair coin twice. If both tosses show heads (HH), the student answers truthfully. For any other outcome (TH, HT, TT), the student answers the opposite of the truth.

Let \( p \) be the proportion of students who would consider an abortion. We want to estimate \( p \).

\subsection*{Probability Calculations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The probability of both tosses being heads (HH) is:
    \[
    P(\text{HH}) = \frac{1}{4}
    \]
    \item The probability of getting any other outcome (TH, HT, TT) is:
    \[
    P(\text{TH or HT or TT}) = \frac{3}{4}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Calculating the Probability of Answering ``Yes''}

The probability of answering ``Yes'' can be split into two cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a student would consider an abortion, they answer ``Yes'' truthfully with probability \( \frac{1}{4} \), and ``No'' with probability \( \frac{3}{4} \).
    \item If a student would not consider an abortion, they answer ``No'' truthfully with probability \( \frac{1}{4} \), and ``Yes'' with probability \( \frac{3}{4} \).
\end{itemize}

Thus, the probability of answering ``Yes'' is:
\[
P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{1}{4}p + \frac{3}{4}(1 - p)
\]
Simplify this expression:
\[
P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{1}{4}p + \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3}{4}p = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2}p
\]

\subsection*{Using the Sample Proportion}

Given that 114 out of 200 students answered ``Yes'', the sample proportion is:
\[
\hat{p} = \frac{114}{200} = 0.57
\]

We use this sample proportion to estimate \( p \):
\[
0.57 = \frac{3}{4} - \frac{1}{2}p
\]
Solve for \( p \):
\[
\frac{1}{2}p = \frac{3}{4} - 0.57
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2}p = 0.75 - 0.57 = 0.18
\]
\[
p = 2 \times 0.18 = 0.36
\]

\subsection*{Conclusion}

The estimated true proportion of students who would consider an abortion is approximately:
\[
\boxed{0.36}
\]
