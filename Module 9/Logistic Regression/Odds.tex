\section{Odds}

Odds are frequently used instead of probabilities when modeling the chance of a certain response. Understanding how to convert between probabilities and odds is crucial for various statistical applications.

\subsection{Probability to Odds}

The odds of an event occurring can be calculated from its probability using the following formula:

\[
\text{Odds} = \frac{p}{1 - p}
\]

where \( p \) is the probability of the event.

\subsection{Odds to Probability}

To convert odds to probability, use the formula:

\[
p = \frac{\text{Odds}}{1 + \text{Odds}}
\]

where \(\text{Odds}\) represents the odds of the event.

\subsection{Examples}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Probability to Odds}
    
    Given: Probability \( p = 0.32 \)

    \[
    \text{Odds} = \frac{0.32}{1 - 0.32} = \frac{0.32}{0.68} \approx 0.471
    \]

    The odds of the event occurring are approximately \textbf{0.471}.

    \item \textbf{Odds to Probability}
    
    Given: Odds = 1.78

    \[
    p = \frac{1.78}{1 + 1.78} = \frac{1.78}{2.78} \approx 0.64
    \]

    The probability of the event occurring is approximately \textbf{0.64}.
